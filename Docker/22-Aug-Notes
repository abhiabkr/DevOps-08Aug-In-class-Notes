Method for portmapping 

Use -P option

In this case we dont provide any port number during the run command, docker system will do random port mapping
of system port and container port

docker run -d --name n1 -P nginx


Volumes in Docker:
*************

2 types of volumes in docker


1. Named volume:


Demo1: Let us create a volume and give a name to the volume

Volume is a directory in whcih we will preserve containers data

where will this named volume directlry be available: it will under /var/lib/docker/volumes

$ docker volume create myvol

docker volume ls

docker volume inspect myvol

Location where the colume is created: /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data


Demo 2: preserving the data of the container on the volume directory

 docker run -it --name u1 -v myvol:/tmp ubuntu

 you will be on the container

 cd tmp
 touch file1 file 2

come out of container

ctl pq

go to vol directory

/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data

ls

all the data will be there

Demo 3: Create a file in the volume directory and check if the data is available on the container or not

Assignment:
Demo 4: Containers sharing the data


2. Bind mounts

Is a type of volume using which you can preserve data of the container on any directory of the host machine


 volume mappping will be done as:

 -v anydirectoryHost:directoryofcontainer

Volume mapping has to be done at runtime only

once container is created you cannot do volume mapping

> Go to a repo with application code in github

> Fetch all the code to local

 > git clone https://github.com/Sonal0409/ecomm.git

 /root/ecomm

> copy the code on the container directory

 Can be done using volume of type bind mounts

> access the container from the browser my machine
