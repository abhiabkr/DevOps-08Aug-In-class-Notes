PULL files from external repo to local repo
***************************************************
Create files from github and pull the file into local repo

# git pull origin master    /////  pull from origin i.e remote repos and from master branch whatever is the changes.
# ls ==> new file will be there

Fetch files from external repo to local repo
******************************************************
Create a new file on external repo 

# git fetch origin master  //////This command will only fetch the changes but does not merges it with LR or WD. it stores the fetch in .git/fetch head 
folder we can go to that fetch head and copy the id and return to cd .. and write git diff id....we will see which file has been fetched. and choose
which one to take by executing (git checkout origin/branch_name -- file_name). it will merge the file in WD staged area in green color only not to LR. We
have to commit.
fetch is a read only command and pull is read write.

# git pull origin master  ===> pull= fetch +merge.  //// anyone can pull 
*********************************************************

How can we push the files from another branch to remote repo
* First check the branches git branch
* now checkout to someother branch other than master  
git checkout b1
* check git log make file add and commit and then puch to origin.It will not go to master branch
* as command is 
git push origin b1. 
It will create a b1 brnch in github.

Now we have made a b1 branch and pushed changes to it and want to merge it with master so the developer will create a pull request
base master compare b1. this pull request will go to owner of the repository.


# git pull remotebranch localbranchname
# ls    //All files will be there in local as same as remote

Fetch only specific file from remote Master branch
**********************************************

# git fetch --all

# git checkout origin/<branch_name> -- fileName

# git checkout origin/master -- fileDave

Conflicts in external and local repo.
*****************************************
Create a file in remote repo file5.txt ==> add text
Now create a file in local repo ==> same name file5.txt  ==> add text
# git add file5.txt
# git commit -m “local file5”

Now without pulling from remote just push your changes

# git push origin master 

It will give conflict as there are changes in remote repo file

So we have to first pull chnages from external repo , add them , commit them and then push our changes

# git pull origin

Agin conflict will be there

Resolve conflict again

# vim file5.txt ==> add the content required
# git commit -a -m “new chnages”

# git pull origin

# git push origin master  ==> give credentials

All changes will be there

Cloning a repository
*************************************************
Suppose a new team member has joined he doesnot have any code. he need to create a LR and WD.
But instead of doing this he can clone. He will not create LR or WD
he just have to install git and run command from his machine
** git clone url of remote repo

This command will create WD and LR.

***************************************************

If we want like b1 branch from remote repo then 
git clone -b b1 urlOfThe Repo

it will fetch the specific branch only


***************************************************

Forking

copying someother repository into some others account

Go to github--> create a new repository 
Use this repo:
https://github.com/Sonal0409/7AMGITDEMO

On host machine:
Create an emplty directory
# cd ..
# pwd

# mkdir project2
# cd project2
# git clone URL of new external repository

==> it will copy all the files from external to your local repository

# ls
# cd directoryname/
# ls  ==> files will be shown
# ll -al  ==> all files and .git file will also be there
